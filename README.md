## Running the Application

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to run ReWear is using **Docker Compose**. This will automatically start the frontend, backend, and AI model without needing to install dependencies locally. Application data is persisted through a SQLite database file stored in Docker-managed persistent storage, rather than a separate database service.

1.  **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project root.
2.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
3.  **Access the app**:
    - Frontend: [http://localhost](http://localhost) (via Nginx proxy)

*Note: The first build may take a few minutes as it installs dependencies and configures the AI environment.*

### Option 2: Manual Development Setup

If you prefer to run the components manually:

#### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Python 3.10+**

#### 1. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Set up the Python environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Start the Flask backend
```bash
python -m rewear_app.app
# Backend runs at http://localhost:5001
```

#### 4. Start the Vite dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` and `/uploads/*` requests to
`http://localhost:5001`, so no CORS configuration is needed during development.

## Testing

Unit tests were added for the backend Flask application and cover:

- Authentication endpoints and session handling
- Items CRUD operations and validation
- Outfits creation and item assignment logic
- SQLAlchemy models and database constraints
- Serialization helpers for API responses

Detailed instructions and the full test suite summary are available in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## #designthinking

The ReWear team ran three interview rounds tied to progressively maturing product stages. Interview I (February, 11 respondents, concept stage) validated the core premise and converted user feedback into a feature-vote table that set MVP 1 scope (PR #12), also correcting the team's assumption that users had a strong preference between scanning and photo upload. Interview II (March, 2 respondents, working MVP) surfaced visual polish concerns and seasonal context limitations that directly drove the MVP 2 redesign (PR #19) and the "Postpone until" feature. Interview III (April, 4 respondents, near-final build) closed the loop, the redesign was praised and two final-sprint bugs were identified, culminating in MVP 3 (PR #26). The ~70% camera detection accuracy was acknowledged as a technical ceiling beyond CS162 scope.

# Introduction

Fashion brands now produce nearly twice as much clothing as they did before 2000. The industry generates over 92 million tonnes of waste annually (Niinimäki et al., 2020). However, studies reveal that nearly 25% of clothing in closets is never used (de Wagenaar et al., 2022). Environmental harm and financial waste result from underutilization. **Rewear** helps users make the most of their current wardrobes by turning wardrobe tracking into a quick daily routine that shows wear patterns and recommends items they may have forgotten.

# Problem

Underutilization of clothing is a critical problem at the intersection of consumer behavior, financial waste, and environmental sustainability. Use of a single clothing garment has declined by almost 40% in the last 15 years (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2019). Even when the current closet meets the same needs, a main psychological driver of continued purchasing is the perceived lack of outfit options (Laitala & Klepp, 2020). This creates a reinforcing cycle of overconsumption.

The consequences extend across multiple dimensions. According to Niinimäki et al. (2020), impacts include over 79 trillion litres of water wasted by clothes manufacturing brands. People continue this cycle by buying unnecessary replacements and duplicates when they do not use their existing wardrobes. According to research on clothing use behavior, reducing the purchase of new clothing has the biggest potential to reduce global carbon emissions associated with fashion consumption (Koch et al., 2025).

# Proposed Solution

Popular wardrobe-tracking apps like Stylebook (100k+ downloads) demonstrate people's willingness to engage with outfit tracking, but they focus primarily on style planning rather than optimization. Rewear takes a different approach: by making daily outfit logging effortless (under 10 seconds) and immediately providing insights about wear patterns, the web app gives the closet a data-driven use.

Unlike existing digital closet apps that require taking a picture of every item individually—a barrier that prevents most users from completing setup—Rewear uses **progressive cataloging**, where users simply snap quick photos each morning of what they're wearing.

# Description

Rewear is a web application designed to help users understand how they actually use their wardrobe by tracking daily outfit wear. Rather than asking users to fully log their closets, the system focuses on low-effort daily logging and builds insights gradually over time.

The core user flow centers on a quick daily check-in:

1. Open the app in a browser
2. Upload a photo of the day's outfit
3. Confirm AI-proposed item tagging (with manual correction if needed)

Each action takes about 10 seconds. As data is gathered, the app reveals insights progressively:

- **After one week:** Users can see which items they've worn at least once
- **After two weeks:** The app highlights which items appear most frequently in outfits
- **After one month:** Users receive a high-level wardrobe utilization score showing how much of their closet is actually being used

An optional one-time closet log can be used to set a baseline, but it is not required for the web app to function.

# Target Audience

Target users are students and young adults (Gen Z, ages 18–34) interested in fashion, self-tracking, or sustainability. Many already take outfit photos, own moderate to large wardrobes, and experience decision fatigue or "closet blindness." ReWear helps them understand and use what they already own.

**Primary segments include:**

- University students
- Young professionals managing growing closets on tight budgets
- Sustainability-minded users
- Content creators who already document outfits

**Secondary users include:**

- People experimenting with capsule wardrobes
- Individuals casually tracking clothing habits
